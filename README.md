# phys_adv_classical_mechanics

This repository contains the homework from my Advanced Classical Mechanics course. While they note be of grave utility I think their quite interesting, applicable problems and I'm sure other physics nerds will be entertained by their solutions and implications. If nothing else, check out the Coriolis force homework, I find it super interesting.
